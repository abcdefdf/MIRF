# MIRF

Adverse_detector.py and new_insc.py evaluate the challenges of MIRF against adversarial DGA, respectively.
Adverse_detector.py is about incremental training effectiveness analysis and finds that MIRF addresses the challenge of ineffective incremental training.

New_insc.py is about the analysis of catastrophic forgetting problem. It is found that MIRF solves the catastrophic forgetting problem by experimental results.
